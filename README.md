There are raster tiles, created with [QTiles Plugin](https://github.com/nextgis/QTiles).
They have to be stored appropriately to [TensorFlow Documentation](http://tflearn.org/data_utils/#image-preloader) for being processed.

The repository will also contain some learned models as well as example codes.
